## beamup

This is forked from [wojtekmach/beamup](https://github.com/wojtekmach/beamup) -- we had to re-push it ourselves becauase GitHub actions don't work very well with forked repos.

A proof-of-concept BEAM installer.

## Components

This project contains four main components:

### 1. Builder - builds OTP releases

- [`build_otp.sh`](scripts/build_otp.sh) script

- [`build_otp.yml`](.github/workflows/build_otp.yml) workflow that is triggered by an [`workflow_dispatch`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch) event. (It can be triggered manually from GitHub UI or automatically by the `sync_otp_releases.yml` workflow below.)

  This workflow checks if a given release exists (see "Hosting" below) and if not, builds it using `scripts/build_otp.sh` and uploads it.

- [`sync_otp_releases.yml`](.github/workflows/sync_otp_releases.yml) workflow that is running once an hour, syncing [`erlang/otp`](https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases) and [`wojtekmach/otp_releases`](https://github.com/wojtekmach/otp_releases/releases) releases and triggering release building.

`build_otp.yml` uses the `ubuntu-16.04` and `macos-10.15` GitHub Actions runners so that we build releases for the `linux-x86_64` and `darwin-x86_64` targets. I've additionally built locally and uploaded releases for `linux-aarch64` and `darwin-arm64`.

### 2. Hosting - on GitHub releases

Currently we use a separate GitHub repository that just holds releases so that we can upload
assets. Eventually we hope to simply use <https://github.com/erlang/otp/releases>.

See: <https://github.com/wojtekmach/otp_releases/releases>

### 3. Installer - installs releases

Example:

```
$ export OTP_VERSION=23.2.7 ELIXIR_VERSION=1.11.3 GLEAM_VERSION=0.14.2 && \
   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wojtekmach/beamup/master/install.sh | bash
$ export PATH=$HOME/.local/share/beamup/bin:$PATH
$ elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.1.8] [source] [64-bit] [smp:8:8] [ds:8:8:10] [async-threads:1]

Elixir 1.11.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 21)
$ gleam --version
gleam 0.14.2
```

See [`install.sh`](install.sh).

We download pre-compiled binaries from:

- for OTP: <https://github.com/wojtekmach/otp_releases/releases> (including the latest Rebar3 from <http://rebar3.org>)
- for Elixir: <https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/releases>
- for Gleam: <https://github.com/gleam-lang/gleam/releases>

Example with Docker:

```
$ docker run --rm -it ubuntu bash

docker$ apt update && apt install -y curl unzip && export LANG=C.UTF-8

docker$ export OTP_VERSION=23.2.7 ELIXIR_VERSION=1.11.3 && \
         curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wojtekmach/beamup/master/install.sh | bash

docker$ elixir --version
Erlang/OTP 23 [erts-11.1.8] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:1]

Elixir 1.11.3 (compiled with Erlang/OTP 21)
```

### 4. `setup-beam` - installs BEAM languages on GitHub actions

Example:

```yaml
- uses: wojtekmach/beamup/setup-beam@master
  with:
    otp-version: 24.0-rc1
    elixir-version: 1.11.3
    gleam-version: 0.14.2
- run: elixir --version
```

## Notes

```
# test
./test/test.sh workflow_dispatch -e <(echo '{"inputs":{"version":"23.2.7"}}') -r

# trigger workflow dispatch
gh api -XPOST repos/wojtekmach/beamup/actions/workflows/build_otp.yml/dispatches \
  --input <(echo '{"ref":"master","inputs":{"version":"23.2.7"}}')

# build release tarball locally and upload it
version=23.2.7; \
  release=otp-${version}-$(uname -sm | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-').tar.gz; \
  time ./scripts/build_otp.sh $version && \
  gh release upload -R wojtekmach/otp_releases OTP-$version $TMPDIR/beamup/$release.tar.gz
```
